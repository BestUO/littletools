If you want test this process,firstly mkdir "TRIMULE" in "/home".
And copy  both "build/Trimule" and "conf" where in the project to "/home/TRIMULE" (ps: cinfigure "docker_run.sh" out.)
Then use "docker_build.sh" to build container.(Firsttime may be slowly,be patient.)
Later,"docker_run.sh" will run the process.
